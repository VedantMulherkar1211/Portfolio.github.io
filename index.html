        <div>
            <p>Hello, I am Vedant Dharmendra Mulherkar, a computer engineering graduate from Mumbai Education Trust BKC
                Institution of Engineering in Nashik, under the University of Pune. I am proud to have achieved a First
                Class Distinction in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                My educational journey began in Nashik, where I completed my secondary schooling and higher secondary
                schooling. In 2022, during my college years, I had the opportunity to undergo a corporate internship at
                Persistent Systems in Pune.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that I join persistent as full time employee where I work on Data Integration project and my
                client was Kantar Media.
            </p>
            In addition, I was selected for the Zensar EDS program in 2021. This program provided me with an
            excellent
            platform to enhance my programming techniques and broaden my understanding of various tools.

            I possess a diverse set of skills, including Java core, SQL, Linux, and Git. Moreover, I have a keen
            interest in continuously expanding my knowledge and keeping up with the latest advancements in the
            industry.

            Outside of academics and work, I find joy in cycling, traveling, and engaging in content creation
            related to
            teaching and video editing. These hobbies allow me to explore my creative side and express my passion
            for
            sharing knowledge.

            Throughout my educational journey, I have achieved several certifications, including the MS Azure
            Fundamentals 900. Additionally, I have actively participated in various hackathons, one of which was
            organized by the Indian Army and focused on cybersecurity and machine learning.

            I am an enthusiastic learner who is always eager to embrace new technologies and concepts. Equally
            important
            to me is the opportunity to share my knowledge and contribute to the growth of others.

            Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am excited to embark on new challenges and make
            meaningful contributions in the field of computer engineering.
            </p>
